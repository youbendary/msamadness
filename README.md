**MSA Madness Website**

A full-stack web application developed to support the local Muslim charity organization, MSA Madness. The website facilitates event registration and provides resources for hosting charity events, including a statewide 16-team basketball tournament that attracted over 300 spectators and raised nearly $5,000 for local charities.
